// Folds over a Maybe value.
// - A: The type of the value inside Maybe.
// - B: The type of the result.
// - m: The Maybe value to fold over.
// - d: The value to return if the Maybe is None.
// - f: The function to apply to the value if the Maybe is Some.
// = Either the default value (if None) or the result of applying f to the value (if Some).
